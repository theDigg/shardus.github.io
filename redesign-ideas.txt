An Attention-Grabbing Effect
Particle animation is one of those cases where smaller is better.
The tinier the dots, the more impressive of an effect that can be achieved.
On the one hand, it looks sophisticated and intricate since geometry and physics 
are involved. On the other hand, it looks fragile and subtle thanks to delicate shapes. 
This unique fusion makes particle animation exceptional and attention-grabbing.
